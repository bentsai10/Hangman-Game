<h3>How Word Garden Works</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Type a letter to guess. If you're correct, the flower stays intact. If not, a petal is lost!</li>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Correct Guess:</strong><img src = "/images/white_space.png" height = "10" width = "270"><strong>Incorrect Guess:</strong></p>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/correct_guess.gif" height = "500"></kbd><img src = "/images/white_space.png" height = "10" width = "200"><kbd><img src = "/images/wrong_guess.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <p align = "center"></p>
  <li>If you correctly guess the word, you save the flower, and you have the chance to keep your conservation efforts going!</li>
</ol>
