<p><strong>Word Garden's purpose:</strong><br>Provide a fresh and family-friendly way to play Hangman by replacing the gruesome image of hanging with a wilting flower</p>

  <li>Enjoy your time in the Garden!</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Word Garden Works</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Type a letter to guess. If you're correct, the flower stays intact. If not, a petal is lost! The Garden will track how many guesses you make!</li>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Correct Guess:</strong><img src = "/images/white_space.png" height = "10" width = "300"><strong>Incorrect Guess:</strong></p>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/correct_guess.gif" height = "500"></kbd><img src = "/images/white_space.png" height = "10" width = "200"><kbd><img src = "/images/wrong_guess.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>If you correctly guess the word, you save the flower, and you have the chance to keep your conservation efforts going!</li>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/successful_word.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>If you fail to guess the word, the flower wilts :(, but you can redeem yourself by saving other flowers in the garden!</li>
  <p align = "center"><kbd><img src = "/images/failed_word.gif" height = "500"></kbd></p>
  <li>Start a new game by pressing play again. This time, a new word will be generated!</li>

</ol>
